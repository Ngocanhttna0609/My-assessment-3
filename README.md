## Project Description
This is our assessment 3 for the SLE712 unit at Deakin University. This projects concludes two parts. 

In part 1, we will develop skills in problem solving, R coding, work togerther as a team using Rstudio and GitHub. We are provided with two data files to work with: “gene_expression2.tsv” and “growth_data2.csv” which are available from this URL*:
https://github.com/markziemann/SLE712_les/tree/master/bioinfo_asst3_part1_files. 

In part 2, we will undertake more advanced analysis in R such as:
* Download and unzip files
* Perform simple manipulations and analyses with sequence data
* Use a provided function to incorporate point mutations into a sequence 
* Use provided functions to perform a BLAST search and interpret results

We are provided with a file containing E.coli gene sequence: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markziemann/SLE712_files/master/bioinfo_asst3_part2_files/sample.fa and a file containing the whole set of E.coli genes: ftp://ftp.ensemblgenomes.org/pub/bacteria/release-42/fasta/bacteria_0_collection/escherichia_coli_str_k_12_substr_mg1655/cds/Escherichia_coli_str_k_12_substr_mg1655.ASM584v2.cds.all.fa.gz.
