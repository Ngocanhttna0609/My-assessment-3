## Project Description
This is our assessment 3 for the SLE712 unit at Deakin University. This projects concludes two parts. 
In part 1, we will develop skills in problem solving, R coding, work togerther as a team using Rstudio and GitHub. We are provided with two data files to work with: “gene_expression2.tsv” and “growth_data2.csv” which are available from this URL*:
https://github.com/markziemann/SLE712_les/tree/master/bioinfo_asst3_part1_files. 

In part 2, we will undertake more advanced analysis in R such as:
* Download and unzip files
* Perform simple manipulations and analyses with sequence data
* Use a provided function to incorporate point mutations into a sequence 
* Use provided functions to perform a BLAST search and interpret results
All questions for assessment 3 we can find out here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markziemann/SLE712_files/master/assessment_task3/assessment_task3_writing_guide.Rmd

## Getting Started
*Log in Rstudio
*Log in GitHub
*The file AT3_answers.Rmd contains our answers for the assessment 3.
